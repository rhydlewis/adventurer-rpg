#### Combat System Questions

**Q1:** Full Pathfinder complexity or simplified variant?
Take the core feel of Pathfinder but streamline it for single-player browser gameplay:
- Six core attributes - Keep STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA
- Streamlined actions - Just "standard action" (attack or cast spell)
- d20 attack vs AC - Keep the core mechanic
- Saving throws - Keep Fort/Reflex/Will for spells
- Class features - Key abilities only (Fighter gets +damage, Wizard gets more spells)
- Simple equipment - +1/+2/+3 weapons, light/medium/heavy armor
- Basic conditions - Just stunned, poisoned, strengthened, weakened

**Q2:** Character levels 1-20 or limited range (e.g., 1-5)?
Levels 1-5 (Limited Range)
- Characters cap at level 5, focused experience
- Power curve: Noticeable but manageable
- Level 1: Novice adventurer (12 HP, basic attacks)
- Level 5: Seasoned hero (30 HP, signature abilities unlocked)
- 5-6 spell levels max
- Creatures CR 1/4 to CR 7
- Will result in:
    - a tight, curated experience
    - Faster campaigns - Beat the game in 1-2 hours, replay with different class
    - Easier balance - Power scaling is linear, not exponential
    - Clear identity - Each class feels distinct without 100 abilities

**Q3:** Include feats and skills or keep streamlined?
- Simplified feats - 10-15 impactful feats, no complex prerequisites
- Core skills only - 5-8 important skills (Athletics, Stealth, Perception, etc.)

**Q4:** How to handle solo play balance (normally designed for parties)?
- Keep one-on-one battles - Don't add multiple enemies
- Buff solo heroes by 20-30% - More HP, better stats than standard
- Give hybrid abilities - Every class gets some healing/defense
- Generous rest system - Heal frequently between fights
