# Save DC

 **Save DC** stands for **Save Difficulty Class**.

**What it means:**
- **Save** refers to a saving throw - a roll made by the player character to resist or avoid negative effects like spells, poisons, traps, or other harmful abilities
- **DC** stands for Difficulty Class - a target number that must be met or exceeded for the save to succeed

**How it works:**
- When a character is affected by something that requires a saving throw (like a fireball spell or poison), the game determines the Save DC
- The player rolls a die (usually a d20) and adds their relevant modifier (like Dexterity, Wisdom, or Constitution)
- If the total equals or exceeds the Save DC, the save succeeds and the character avoids or resists the effect
- If it's less than the DC, the save fails and the character suffers the negative effects

**Example:**
- A fireball spell has a Save DC of 15
- Player character has a Wisdom modifier of +3
- Player rolls a 12 on their d20
- Total = 12 + 3 = 15, which equals the DC, so the save succeeds
- If the total was 14, the save would fail and the character takes fire damage

Save DCs are used throughout RPGs to balance challenge and player agency, making encounters appropriately difficult without being frustratingly impossible.
