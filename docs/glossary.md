# Save DC

 **Save DC** stands for **Save Difficulty Class**.

**What it means:**
- **Save** refers to a saving throw - a roll made by the player character to resist or avoid negative effects like spells, poisons, traps, or other harmful abilities
- **DC** stands for Difficulty Class - a target number that must be met or exceeded for the save to succeed

**How it works:**
- When a character is affected by something that requires a saving throw (like a fireball spell or poison), the game determines the Save DC
- The player rolls a die (usually a d20) and adds their relevant modifier (like Dexterity, Wisdom, or Constitution)
- If the total equals or exceeds the Save DC, the save succeeds and the character avoids or resists the effect
- If it's less than the DC, the save fails and the character suffers the negative effects

**Example:**
- A fireball spell has a Save DC of 15
- Player character has a Wisdom modifier of +3
- Player rolls a 12 on their d20
- Total = 12 + 3 = 15, which equals the DC, so the save succeeds
- If the total was 14, the save would fail and the character takes fire damage

Save DCs are used throughout RPGs to balance challenge and player agency, making encounters appropriately difficult without being frustratingly impossible.

# CR - Challenge Rating

In Dungeons & Dragons (and in many other tabletop RPGs that borrow the terminology) **Challenge Rating**—often abbreviated **CR**—is a numeric indicator of how difficult an monster or encounter is for a
typical adventuring party.

The concept was introduced in the original *Dungeon Master’s Guide* and has been refined in every edition, most recently in **5th Edition**.  Think of CR as a “difficulty score” that the game uses to help
DMs (or designers) balance combat encounters and to award experience points.

## How CR Works in D&D 5e

| Element | What it means |
|---------|----------------|
| **CR number** | The level at which a *single* monster can pose a “moderate” threat to a party of characters whose combined levels roughly equal that number.  Roughly: *If you pit the creature against a 
group of PCs whose total level is about equal to its CR, the fight will be an even‑matched challenge.* |
| **Experience Points (XP)** | Every monster has an XP value printed in its stat block (e.g., “CR 5 → 1,800 XP”). When a party defeats it, each player gets XP equal to that value divided by the number of 
players, scaled up or down depending on how many PCs are involved. |
| **Encounter Difficulty** | The DM can combine several monsters whose total “adjustable CR” (after applying size/number adjustments) matches the desired difficulty: *Easy*, *Medium*, *Hard*, *Deadly*.  
This is the “XP Thresholds” table in the DMG. |
| **Adjustments** | Certain rules shift a monster’s effective CR: <br>• If a creature has multiple attacks, you may add +1 or +2 to its CR.<br>• A group of identical smaller foes counts as a higher‑CR 
encounter (e.g., six goblins ≈ CR 2‑3).<br>• Monsters with special abilities that dramatically increase their survivability or damage output can be “bumped up” one or two levels. |

### Quick Reference – What Different CRs Mean

| Party Level | Expected Monster CR for a **Medium** (balanced) Encounter |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–2          | ~1 / 5 of party total level (e.g., a 3‑player party around levels 1‑2 → monsters roughly CR 0.5–1) |
| 3–4          | ≈ Party’s average level – 2 to +1                |
| 5–6          | Same as above, but you can go one level higher                 |
| …            | …                                                   |

*In practice many DMs use the “party’s average level = monster CR” rule of thumb for a **single‑target** encounter. For multiple monsters they add up the XP and then compare to the party’s total XP
budget.*

## Why Use CR?

1. **Scaling Difficulty Fast** – Instead of manually tweaking hit points, damage, or special abilities each time you want a harder fight, you can select monsters with higher CRs.
2. **XP Distribution** – The game ties monster XP directly to CR, so the math for awarding experience is standardized.
3. **Planning Balance** – By adding together the CRs (or more precisely the total XP values) of several foes, a DM can aim for *Easy / Medium / Hard / Deadly* fights without trial‑and‑error.
4. **Design Consistency** – When designing homebrew monsters or pulling enemies from published bestiaries, designers often “budget” them by giving them a CR that fits the power level they intend.

## How Other RPGs Use a Similar Idea

| Game | Term / Mechanic | Rough Equivalent to D&D CR |
|------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Pathfinder 2e** | **Level** (monster “level” is basically a direct analogue to CR) – XP budgets are also used. |
| **Savage Worlds** | **Threat Rating** / “Danger Rating”. Not called CR but the concept of rating difficulty per monster exists. |
| **Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay** | **Encounter Level** or “Challenge Rating” is listed for some monsters (though often expressed as a numeric “difficulty” rather than a formal CR). |
| **Computer‑RPG / Loot‑Based Games** | Enemy “level” or “rank” functions similarly; many developers explicitly label them “CR”, especially when they borrow D&D’s XP/XP curve. |

In all these systems the core idea is identical: *a numeric value that tells you how tough a creature (or group of creatures) should be for characters around a given power level.*

## Example Walk‑through

Suppose you have a party of **four 3rd‑level** adventurers.

1. **Find XP Thresholds** – From the DMG table, a *Medium* encounter at that tier gives each player about 600 XP total (i.e., ~2,400 XP for the whole party).
2. **Pick a Monster** – Looking up “Bugbear” in the Monster Manual:
    - CR 1/2 → 100 XP each.
3. **Calculate XP per Monster** – Four bugbears would give `4 × 100 = 400 XP` → well under a Medium budget, so they’re *Easy* to that party.
4. **Scale Up** – Add two ogres (CR 2 each → 450 XP). Now total XP ≈ `2×450 + 4×100 = 1,300 XP`, which nudges the encounter into “Medium‑High”.  
   So you have an encounter whose **effective CR** (by XP budget) sits around **CR 2–3**, perfect for a party averaging level 3.

## TL;DR

- **CR = Challenge Rating**
- It quantifies how hard a monster or encounter is relative to characters.
- 1 CR roughly equals “the difficulty a character of that CR would face solo.”
- Monsters have an XP value tied to their CR, letting the DM award experience automatically.
- Use it (or its equivalent in other systems) to balance combat encounters without constantly re‑balancing numbers by hand.

If you’re building your own monsters or pulling them from existing tables, keep an eye on that little number—it’s the quickest way to know whether a foe will be a cakewalk, a good workout, or a lethal
showdown for your heroes.
