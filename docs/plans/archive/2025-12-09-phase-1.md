# Phase 1: Core d20 Mechanics - Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-12-09
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14
**Status:** Phase 1.1 ✅ Complete | Phase 1.2 ✅ Complete | Phase 1.3 ✅ Complete | Phase 1.4 ✅ Complete | Phase 1.5 ✅ Complete
**Scope:** Implement all 4 character classes with distinct mechanics, spell system, and mobile-optimized UI

---

## Overview

Phase 1 transforms the walking skeleton into a complete d20 combat system with full class differentiation. This phase is divided into three sequential steps:

1. **Step 1: Class Differentiation** - Make Fighter/Rogue/Wizard/Cleric feel distinctly different
2. **Step 2: Spell System** - Complete spell infrastructure for Wizard/Cleric
3. **Step 3: Combat Variety** - Multiple enemy types using different tactics and conditions

## Skills System

### 6 Core Skills
1. **Athletics (STR)** - Class skill: Fighter
2. **Stealth (DEX)** - Class skill: Rogue
3. **Perception (WIS)** - Class skill: Rogue
4. **Arcana (INT)** - Class skill: Wizard
5. **Medicine (WIS)** - Class skill: Cleric

- **Others:** Affect story/skill checks (Phase 2+)

---

## Feat System

### Feat Progression (Levels 1-5)
- **Fighter:** Feats at levels 1, 2, 4 (3 total)
- **Other classes:** Feats at levels 3, 5 (2 total)

### Combat Feats (Fighter Level 1)

---

## Action Economy

### Single Action Per Turn (Streamlined)
Each turn, choose ONE action:

- **Rogue:** Attack, Sneak Attack (auto when conditions met), Dodge, Use Item
- **Wizard:** Attack (rarely), Cast Cantrip, Cast Spell, Use Item
- **Cleric:** Attack, Cast Cantrip, Cast Spell, Channel Energy, Use Item

**Move action:** Automatic/free (positioning doesn't matter in 1v1 combat)

---

## Saving Throws System

### Calculation
- **Fort Save:** Base (class) + CON modifier
- **Reflex Save:** Base (class) + DEX modifier
- **Will Save:** Base (class) + WIS modifier

### DC Calculation
- **Spell DC:** 10 + spell level + casting ability modifier
- **Example:** Wizard (INT 16, +3) casts Sleep (level 1): DC = 10 + 1 + 3 = 14

### Save Types
- **Negates:** Success = no effect (Sleep, Stun, Silence)
- **Half:** Success = half damage (Burning Hands)
- **Partial:** Success = reduced duration (Poison: 2→1 turns)

### Usage
1. Attacker sets DC
2. Defender rolls: 1d20 + save bonus vs DC
3. Apply result based on save type

---

## Combat Mechanics

### Initiative
- **Roll once at combat start:** 1d20 + DEX mod + bonuses
- **Bonuses:**
  - Improved Initiative feat: +4
  - Perception ≥3 ranks: +2
  - Stealth ≥5 total: +2
- **Highest goes first** (re-roll if tied)
- **Same turn order for entire combat**

### Critical Hits (Natural 20)
- Automatic hit regardless of AC
- **Roll damage dice twice, add modifiers once**
- Example: Longsword crit = 2d8+STR (not 1d8+STR)
- Sneak Attack doubles: 2d8+2d6+STR
- Spell damage doubles: Ray of Frost = 2d3
- Combat log: "CRITICAL HIT!" message

### Critical Fumbles (Natural 1)
- Automatic miss regardless of bonuses
- **Roll 1d4 for fumble effect:**
  1. **Drop weapon** - Lose next turn picking it up
  2. **Hit self** - Take 1d4 damage
  3. **Off-balance** - Enemy gets +2 AC until your next turn
  4. **Opening** - Enemy gets free attack immediately
- Combat log: "FUMBLE!" + effect description

---

## Conditions System

### 8 Conditions (5 Debuffs, 3 Buffs)

#### Debuffs
1. **Stunned** - Cannot take actions (1 turn)
2. **Poisoned** - 1d4 damage/turn, -2 attack rolls (fixed duration)
3. **Weakened** - -2 attack/damage (cast on enemies)
4. **Blinded** - -4 attack rolls, cannot cast targeted spells (fixed duration)
5. **Silenced** - Cannot cast spells (2 turns), can attack/use items

#### Buffs
1. **Strengthened** - +2 attack/damage (fixed duration)
2. **Enchanted** - +2 spell attack, +1 spell save DC (fixed duration)
3. **Shielded** - +4 AC (3 turns)

### Mechanics

#### Application
- Source: Spells, abilities, enemy attacks
- Resist: Some require save (1d20 + save vs DC)
- If failed/no save: Condition applies immediately

#### Duration Tracking
- Each condition has fixed duration (1-3 turns)
- Countdown at end of affected creature's turn
- Display: "[Poisoned: 2 turns]" under character HP

#### Stacking Rules
- **Multiple different conditions:** YES (Poisoned + Weakened)
- **Same condition multiple times:** NO (duration resets to highest)

#### Visual Display
- Condition icons/badges on character panel
- Tooltip: Effect description + turns remaining
- Color-coded: Red (debuff), Green (buff)

### Architectural Principles
1. **Separation of data and logic** - `/data` holds definitions, `/utils` has calculations
2. **Type safety** - All game entities have strict TypeScript types
3. **Store-based state** - Zustand stores manage game state
4. **Incremental extension** - Extend existing files rather than rewrite

---

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Unit Tests (Required for All Utils)

Write comprehensive unit tests for all `/utils` functions using Vitest. Tests must be written alongside implementation.

**Phase 1.1 - Character Creation Utils:**
- `src/__tests__/utils/pointBuy.test.ts`
  - Test point buy calculations (valid/invalid allocations)
  - Test attribute cost table (7-18 range)
  - Test remaining points calculation
- `src/__tests__/utils/characterCreation.test.ts`
  - Test character initialization from class + attributes
  - Test HP calculation (base + CON mod, buffed for solo)
  - Test AC calculation (armor + shield + DEX mod)
  - Test save calculations (base + ability mod)
- `src/__tests__/utils/skills.test.ts`
  - Test skill bonus calculation (ranks + ability mod + class bonus)
  - Test Rogue expertise (+4 automatic)
  - Test valid rank allocation (0-4 at level 1)
- `src/__tests__/utils/equipment.test.ts`
  - Test equipment assignment by class
  - Test weapon damage calculation
  - Test armor AC contributions

**Phase 1.2 - Combat Foundation Utils:**

**Phase 1.3 - Class Abilities Utils:**
- `src/__tests__/utils/classAbilities.test.ts`
  - Fighter: Second Wind healing (1d10+1), Power Attack math (-2/+4)
  - Rogue: Sneak Attack conditions, Dodge AC bonus (+4)
  - Wizard: Spell slot management, Arcane Recovery
  - Cleric: Channel Energy healing (1d6), Turn Undead DC

**Phase 1.4 - Conditions Utils:**
- `src/__tests__/utils/conditions.test.ts`
  - Test condition application/removal
  - Test duration countdown
  - Test stacking rules (different vs same)
  - Test condition effects on stats (debuffs/buffs)

**Phase 1.5 - Rest Utils:**
- `src/__tests__/utils/rest.test.ts`
  - Test short rest restoration (encounter abilities only)
  - Test long rest restoration (everything)
  - Test resource tracking after rest

### Manual/Integration Tests

**After each phase implementation, manually verify:**

**Phase 1.1:** ✅ VERIFIED
- ✅ Character creation flow works in UI
- ✅ All 4 classes can be created with recommended arrays
- ✅ Fighter can select feat at creation
- ✅ Character sheet displays all stats correctly

**Phase 1.2:** ✅ VERIFIED (except action UI)
- ✅ Initiative rolls at combat start, determines turn order
- ✅ Critical hits show "CRITICAL HIT!" and deal double dice damage
- ✅ Fumbles show "FUMBLE!" with appropriate effect
- ❌ Action selection UI shows all available actions - **NOT DONE** (moved to 1.3)

**Phase 1.3:**
- Each class ability button appears and works
- Resource counters show uses remaining
- Abilities have correct effects in combat

**Phase 1.4:**
- Conditions appear as badges/icons on character panel
- Duration countdown works each turn
- Multiple conditions can be active simultaneously

**Phase 1.5:**
- Rest screens appear after combat
- Short rest restores only encounter abilities
- Long rest restores everything (HP, spells, daily abilities)

**Phase 1.6:**
- All screens display correctly on mobile devices (320px-768px width)
- Buttons are easily tappable (44px minimum touch target)
- Text is readable without zooming (minimum 16px base font)
- Character sheet doesn't require horizontal scrolling
