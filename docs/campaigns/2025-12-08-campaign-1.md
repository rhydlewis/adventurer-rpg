### Act 0: First Blood (Tutorial Prologue)
**Location:** The village of **Ashford** (TBC) & **Blackwood Forest**.

**Purpose:** This introductory act serves as the tutorial, teaching players the dialogue system, combat mechanics, and character selection. It establishes the world and sets the player on the path toward Oakhaven.

*   **Character Selection:**
    *   The player arrives at the village gates and is stopped by a guard who asks their profession.
    *   **Choice Point:** Player selects their class (Fighter/Rogue/Wizard/Cleric) through dialogue options.
    *   Each class choice triggers a brief flavor text describing the character's background.

*   **The Burning Village:**
    *   **Atmosphere:** Chaos and destruction. Buildings smolder, villagers run about trying to save what they can. The acrid smell of smoke fills the air.
    *   **The Guard's Report:** An exhausted village guard blocks the path, looking suspicious and desperate.
    *   **Dialogue Tutorial:** Players learn the dialogue UI by speaking with the guard.
        *   Guard explains: *"Bandits came in the night. Took everything of value and set fire to half the village."*
        *   Player can ask follow-up questions: *"How many were there?"* *"Which way did they go?"* *"Anyone hurt?"*
        *   Optional [Intimidate DC 10] check to get more information or bypass certain dialogue.

*   **Investigation Phase:**
    *   **Explore the Village:** Players can move through the burning streets and talk to multiple NPCs:
        *   **The Innkeeper:** Lost her life savings, describes the bandit leader (scarred face, cruel laugh).
        *   **The Blacksmith:** His forge was ransacked, but he offers the player a basic weapon if they promise to hunt the bandits.
        *   **A Wounded Militia:** Provides tactical information - the bandits fled east toward the Blackwood Forest, maybe 4-5 of them.
        *   **The Mayor:** Offers a reward for recovering the stolen goods and bringing the bandits to justice.
    *   **Choice Point:** Players can accept the quest formally, gather supplies, or decline and leave (though declining ends this prologue).

*   **Into the Blackwood:**
    *   **The Forest Entrance:** Players follow the bandit trail into the dark woods. The forest grows quieter and more ominous.
    *   **Tracking Sequence:**
        *   [Perception DC 12] to follow the tracks successfully (leads directly to bandit leader).
        *   Failure means a longer route with a minor encounter (corrupted wildlife or a trap).
    *   **Environmental Storytelling:** Discarded loot, cart wheel ruts, broken branches showing the bandits' hasty retreat.

*   **The Wounded Bandit Leader:**
    *   **Discovery:** In a small clearing, the player finds the bandit leader slumped against a tree, badly injured (attacked by forest creatures or rival bandits).
    *   **Dialogue Options:**
        *   *"Where's the rest of your gang?"* (He laughs - they abandoned him)
        *   *"Where are the stolen goods?"* (Hidden in the camp ahead)
        *   [Intimidate] *"Talk, or I'll finish what the forest started"*
        *   [Heal/Medicine] Offer to help him (he still attacks, but provides info first)
        *   *"I'm here for justice"* (Skip to combat)
    *   **Combat Tutorial:** The bandit leader attacks, forcing the first combat encounter.
        *   **Combat UI Tutorial:** This fight introduces attack rolls, damage, HP tracking, and combat log.
        *   Enemy uses basic attack, maybe one special ability depending on class implementation status.

*   **After Victory:**
    *   Searching the bandit reveals:
        *   A small pouch of gold (partial loot from the village)
        *   A mysterious letter bearing an unfamiliar seal - mentions a meeting in **Oakhaven** and references "the package" and "the tower"
        *   A crudely drawn map showing the forest path toward Oakhaven
    *   **Companion Introduction:** The player finds or activates "The Elder" artifact nearby (possibly dropped by the bandit, or found in ancient ruins he was raiding). The Elder speaks for the first time, offering cryptic hints about Oakhaven.

*   **Journey to Oakhaven:**
    *   A short travel montage as the player follows the map through the Blackwood Forest toward Oakhaven.
    *   Flavor text: *"The letter suggests something larger at play. What business did a common bandit have in Oakhaven? And what is this tower they mentioned?"*
    *   **Transition:** The forest begins to thin, and the player sees the warm lights of Oakhaven in the distance.

**Key Features:**
*   **Character Creation Integration:** Class selection feels natural through dialogue
*   **Tutorial Pacing:** Dialogue → Investigation → Tracking → Combat in logical progression
*   **Player Agency:** Multiple dialogue paths, optional investigation, skill check opportunities
*   **Narrative Hook:** The mysterious letter creates intrigue and drives the player toward Act 1
*   **Companion Setup:** Introduces The Elder artifact before the main campaign begins

### Act 1: The Hook & The Approach
**Location:** The village of Oakhaven & The Blackwood Forest.

*   **The Tavern Scene (The Hook):**
    *   The player is resting at *The Splintered Shield*.
    *   **The Rumor:** A terrified poacher claims he saw the ruins of the Old Watchtower glowing with "sickly emerald light" and heard a low, thrumming hum that made his teeth ache.
    *   **The Call to Action:** The local magistrate offers a bounty to investigate, or the player is motivated by a personal desire for a specific artifact rumored to be lost in the tower.
*   **The Journey:**
    *   A short travel montage through the Blackwood. The closer the player gets to the tower, the quieter the forest becomes. No birds, no wind.
    *   **First Encounter:** Not undead, but nature corrupted. Wolves with exposed bone or aggressive, blighted vines.
*   **The Tower Entrance:**
    *   The door is sealed by a magic barrier.
    *   **Puzzle:** The player must find three "Singing Stones" hidden in the courtyard rubble to harmonize with the barrier and shatter it.

### Act 2: The Upper Levels (The Descent)
**Location:** The Tower Interior & The Cellars.

*   **Level 1: The Foyer of Dust:**
    *   **Atmosphere:** Grand but decayed. Tapestries rot on the walls.
    *   **Enemies:** Skeletons.
    *   **The Trap:** A hallway of statues. If the player makes a loud noise (failed stealth or metal armor clanking), the statues fire poisoned darts at the player.
*   **Level 2: The Alchemist’s Laboratory:**
    *   **Plot Point:** The player finds Sorath’s old journals. They reveal his plot eventually driving himself mad with necromancy.
    *   **Mini-Boss:** A "Magic Using Skeleton"
    *   **Loot:** A more powerful sword with a modifier against undead

### Act 3: The Maze (The Grind)
**Location:** The Underground Catacombs.

*   **The Mechanic:** TBC
*   **The Solution:** TBC
*   **The Threats:** Traps and enemies (wraiths, ghouls)
*   **The Treasure:** Hidden behind a secret wall is the *Sun-Shard*, a weapon or consumable item radiating holy light, essential for the final fight.

### Act 4: The Void Sanctum & The Fall
**Location:** The Void Sanctum (The bottom of the dungeon).

*   **The Setting:** A massive cavern where the floor is floating rocks suspended over an infinite purple void. The emerald light is blinding here.
*   **The Confrontation:** Sorath floats in the center, channeling a ritual.
*   **Phase 1: The Minions:** Sorath shields himself, summoning waves of skeletons. The player must survive until the shield lowers.
*   **Phase 2: The Lich:** Sorath engages. He uses ice and necrotic magic.
*   **The Twist:** Defeating Sorath isn't enough. He reforms instantly.
*   **The Climax:** TBC

### Epilogue: The Dawn
*   **Victory:** Sorath crumbles into dust, more details TBC
*   **Rewards:**
    *   A massive hoard of gold.
    *   *Sorath’s Grimoire* (high-value loot or usable for a wizard player).
    *   The tower is cleansed and can become a base of operations for the player.

### Key Features for Single Player Scaling:
1.  **Interactable Environment:** Allow the player to drop chandeliers on enemies or kick skeletons into pits. This helps a solo player manage crowds.
2.  **Rest Points:** Designate "Sanctuary Rooms" within the dungeon where the player can barricade the door and rest without risk of ambush.
3.  **Telegraphed Traps:** Since there is no rogue to scout ahead, describe traps vividly (e.g., "scratches on the floor," "a slightly raised tile") so the player can spot them with player skill, not just dice rolls.
