### Campaign Title: The Spire of the Lich King

**The Villain:** **Sorath** A Lich who has collected magical artifacts and souls for centuries to complete a ritual that will make him truly immortal.

**The Companion:** A non-combat companion for exposition & puzzle hints.
* *Suggestion:* **"The Elder"** a magical artifact of a scholar who died in the tower years ago. This artifact offers advice and lore. This is the final artifact the lich seeks (unknown to the player.)

---

### Act 1: The Hook & The Approach
**Location:** The village of Oakhaven & The Blackwood Forest.

*   **The Tavern Scene (The Hook):**
    *   The player is resting at *The Splintered Shield*.
    *   **The Rumor:** A terrified poacher claims he saw the ruins of the Old Watchtower glowing with "sickly emerald light" and heard a low, thrumming hum that made his teeth ache.
    *   **The Call to Action:** The local magistrate offers a bounty to investigate, or the player is motivated by a personal desire for a specific artifact rumored to be lost in the tower.
*   **The Journey:**
    *   A short travel montage through the Blackwood. The closer the player gets to the tower, the quieter the forest becomes. No birds, no wind.
    *   **First Encounter:** Not undead, but nature corrupted. Wolves with exposed bone or aggressive, blighted vines.
*   **The Tower Entrance:**
    *   The door is sealed by a magic barrier.
    *   **Puzzle:** The player must find three "Singing Stones" hidden in the courtyard rubble to harmonize with the barrier and shatter it.

### Act 2: The Upper Levels (The Descent)
**Location:** The Tower Interior & The Cellars.

*   **Level 1: The Foyer of Dust:**
    *   **Atmosphere:** Grand but decayed. Tapestries rot on the walls.
    *   **Enemies:** Skeletons.
    *   **The Trap:** A hallway of statues. If the player makes a loud noise (failed stealth or metal armor clanking), the statues fire poisoned darts at the player.
*   **Level 2: The Alchemist’s Laboratory:**
    *   **Plot Point:** The player finds Sorath’s old journals. They reveal his plot eventually driving himself mad with necromancy.
    *   **Mini-Boss:** A "Magic Using Skeleton"
    *   **Loot:** A more powerful sword with a modifier against undead

### Act 3: The Maze (The Grind)
**Location:** The Underground Catacombs.

*   **The Mechanic:** TBC
*   **The Solution:** TBC
*   **The Threats:** Traps and enemies (wraiths, ghouls)
*   **The Treasure:** Hidden behind a secret wall is the *Sun-Shard*, a weapon or consumable item radiating holy light, essential for the final fight.

### Act 4: The Void Sanctum & The Fall
**Location:** The Void Sanctum (The bottom of the dungeon).

*   **The Setting:** A massive cavern where the floor is floating rocks suspended over an infinite purple void. The emerald light is blinding here.
*   **The Confrontation:** Sorath floats in the center, channeling a ritual.
*   **Phase 1: The Minions:** Sorath shields himself, summoning waves of skeletons. The player must survive until the shield lowers.
*   **Phase 2: The Lich:** Sorath engages. He uses ice and necrotic magic.
*   **The Twist:** Defeating Sorath isn't enough. He reforms instantly.
*   **The Climax:** TBC

### Epilogue: The Dawn
*   **Victory:** Sorath crumbles into dust, more details TBC
*   **Rewards:**
    *   A massive hoard of gold.
    *   *Sorath’s Grimoire* (high-value loot or usable for a wizard player).
    *   The tower is cleansed and can become a base of operations for the player.

### Key Features for Single Player Scaling:
1.  **Interactable Environment:** Allow the player to drop chandeliers on enemies or kick skeletons into pits. This helps a solo player manage crowds.
2.  **Rest Points:** Designate "Sanctuary Rooms" within the dungeon where the player can barricade the door and rest without risk of ambush.
3.  **Telegraphed Traps:** Since there is no rogue to scout ahead, describe traps vividly (e.g., "scratches on the floor," "a slightly raised tile") so the player can spot them with player skill, not just dice rolls.
